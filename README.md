# Node.js Dota 2 GSI module

`dota2-gsi` provides an event driven interface for Dota 2's live GameState Integration data. When configured, the Dota client will send regular messages to the `dota2-gsi` server, which emits an event for each attribute whenever it changes.

## Installation

`npm install dota2-gsi`

## Usage

```javascript
var d2gsi = require('dota2-gsi');
var server = new d2gsi([options]);
```

The server can be configured by passing an optional object to the constructor:
```
{
    port: The port that the server should listen on (default: 3000),
    ip: The IP address that the server should listen on (default: "0.0.0.0"),
    tokens: A single string or array of strings that are valid auth tokens (default: no auth required)
}
```

The server has one member
```
server.events - An EventEmitter used to notify when new clients connect
```

## Examples

Using events
```javascript
var d2gsi = require('dota2-gsi');
var server = new d2gsi();

server.events.on('newclient', function(client) {
    console.log("New client connection, IP address: " + client.ip);
    if (client.auth && client.auth.token) {
        console.log("Auth token: " + client.auth.token);
    } else {
        console.log("No Auth token");
    }

    client.on('player:activity', function(activity) {
        if (activity == 'playing') console.log("Game started!");
    });
    client.on('hero:level', function(level) {
        console.log("Now level " + level);
    });
    client.on('abilities:ability0:can_cast', function(can_cast) {
        if (can_cast) console.log("Ability0 off cooldown!");
    });
});
```

Polling the gamestate manually. There is no guarantee that all of the objects in the gamestate exist, so be sure to null check or use a try/catch when polling.
```javascript
var d2gsi = require('dota2-gsi');
var server = new d2gsi();

var clients = [];

server.events.on('newclient', function(client) {
    console.log("New client connection, IP address: " + client.ip);
    if (client.auth && client.auth.token) {
        console.log("Auth token: " + client.auth.token);
    } else {
        console.log("No Auth token");
    }
    clients.push(client);
});

setInterval(function() {
    clients.forEach(function(client, index) {
        if (client.gamestate.hero && client.gamestate.hero.level) {
            console.log("Client " + index + " is level " + client.gamestate.hero.level);
        }
    });
}, 10 * 1000); // Every ten seconds
```

Identifying different clients using unique auth tokens. With the changes that allow observers/spectators to receive all data this usually isn't necessary any longer, unless you want to allow multiple spectators to join the server for redundancy.
```javascript
var d2gsi = require('dota2-gsi');
var server = new d2gsi({
    port: 9001,
    tokens: [
        "6hCG4n_team1_player1",
        "6hCG4n_team1_player2",
        "6hCG4n_team1_player3",
        "6hCG4n_team1_player4",
        "6hCG4n_team1_player5"
    ]
});

server.events.on('newclient', function(client) {
    if (client.auth && client.auth.token == "6hCG4n_team1_player1") {
        console.log("Client 1:1 connected");
        client.on('hero:name', function(hero_name) {
            set_LAN_booth_display(1, 1, hero_name); // Set the displays on the TI booths for example
        });
    }
});
```

## Clients and Events

The server `events` member emits the `newclient` event whenever a new client connects (based on IP address), returning the new client object. Each client has three members:

```
client.ip           - IP address of the client
client.auth.token   - Auth token used by the client (auth or auth.token may be null)
client.gamestate    - The latest gamestate received from the client
```

Clients will emit the following events any time they change. This list may not be complete, as Valve can silently change the key names or add news ones at any time. If you discover some new outputs, please send a pull request!

All ```team#``` references may either be ```team2``` for Radiant, or ```team3``` for Dire. All ```player#``` references range from ```player0``` to ```player9```, where 0-4 are the Radiant team and 5-9 are the Dire.

The gamestate object mirrors this structure. For example
```
client.gamestate.abilities.team2.player0.ability1.can_cast
client.gamestate.buildings.dire.dota_badguys_fort.health
```

Child members in the gamestate object may be null, so use ```try/catch``` statements when querying it.

## Quirks
* The client does not announce all keys in an 'added' event, so there's no initial emit for some child attributes. This includes all of `provider`, `map`, and some of `player`. If you're trying to initialise values such as `map:daytime`, the easiest way to achieve it is to wait on the first `map:gametime` event then manually query the values from the gamestate.
* Item and hero names are returned as strings using the console format. Dota 2 Wiki has a list of translations for [items](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cheats#Item_names) and [heroes](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cheats#Hero_names).


## Configuring the Dota 2 Client

To configure the Dota client to report gamestate, you need to add a config file in `steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg\gamestate_integration\`. The file must use the name pattern called `gamestate_integration_*.cfg`, for example `gamestate_integration_dota2-gsi.cfg`.

The following example is included in this repository, you can copy it straight into your Dota directory to get started.
```
"dota2-gsi Configuration"
{
    "uri"               "http://localhost:3000/"
    "timeout"           "5.0"
    "buffer"            "0.1"
    "throttle"          "0.1"
    "heartbeat"         "30.0"
    "data"
    {
        "buildings"     "1"
        "provider"      "1"
        "map"           "1"
        "player"        "1"
        "hero"          "1"
        "abilities"     "1"
        "items"         "1"
        "draft"         "1"
        "wearables"     "1"
    }
    "auth"
    {
        "token"         "hello1234"
    }
}
```

## Caveats

Full player data is now available, but only to spectators and observers (as one would expect). The existing single player GSI data is still available, however the names of events are different to what is listed above. Please refer to previous versions of this readme or query uncomment to console logging in index.js to see which keys are available
